Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\cb1 \
\cb2 We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.\cb1 \
\cb2 Millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.\cb1 \
\cb2 The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.\cb1 \
\cb2 Many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation\'92s infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America\'92s interests first.\cb1 \
\cb2 There is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.\cb1 \
\cb2 This year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America\'92s mission, and the power of American pride.\cb1 \
\cb2 In June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade \'97 the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.\cb1 \
\cb2 In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.\cb1 \
\cb2 In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.\cb1 \
\cb2 We can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.\cb1 \
\cb2 But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution \'97 and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.\cb1 \
\cb2 Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America\'92s future. The decision is ours to make.\cb1 \
\cb2 Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness.\cb1 \
\cb2 Over the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.\cb1 \
\cb2 In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom \'97 a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs \'97 something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.\cb1 \
\cb2 Wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history \'96- 157 million.\cb1 \
\cb2 We passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.\cb1 \
\cb2 We virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.\cb1 \
\cb2 We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty \'97 and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.\cb1 \
\cb2 My Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.\cb1 \
\cb2 We have unleashed a revolution in American energy \'97 the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\cb1 \
\cb2 After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.\cb1 \
\cb2 On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone \'97 almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States \'97 and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.\cb1 \
\cb2 If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn\'92t work that way!\cb1 \
\cb2 We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.\cb1 \
\cb2 This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate \'96 some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.\cb1 \
\cb2 Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.\cb1 \
\cb2 In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\cb1 \
\cb2 And just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population \'97 and far beyond.\cb1 \
\cb2 Alice\'92s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing \'97 and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.\cb1 \
\cb2 In June, I commuted Alice\'92s sentence \'97 and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.\cb1 \
\cb2 When I saw Alice\'92s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.\cb1 \
\cb2 Inspired by stories like Alice\'92s, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.\cb1 \
\cb2 We are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.\cb1 \
\cb2 As we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.\cb1 \
\cb2 The Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.\cb1 \
\cb2 Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.\cb1 \
\cb2 As we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.\cb1 \
\cb2 This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well\uc0\u8209 being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.\cb1 \
\cb2 Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.\cb1 \
\cb2 No issue better illustrates the divide between America\'92s working class and America\'92s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.\cb1 \
\cb2 Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration \'97 reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate \'97 it is cruel.\cb1 \
\cb2 Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.\cb1 \
\cb2 What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?\cb1 \
\cb2 I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.\cb1 \
\cb2 We must choose whether we are defined by our differences \'97 or whether we dare to transcend them.\cb1 \
\cb2 We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance \'97 or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.\cb1 \
\cb2 This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.\cb1 \
\cb2 This is our future \'97 our fate \'97 and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.\cb1 \
\cb2 No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.\cb1 \
\cb2 We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America\'92s destiny \'97 that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!\cb1 \
\cb2 Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!}
